        <h3><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong></h3>

        <ol>

            <li>Add the vegetable oil to the pot and sear the pork for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 20 minutes of cooking the pork, add the Chicken to the Pork and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Remove the Chicken and Pork, then brown the Sausage for another 10-15 minuets. </li>
            <li>At this point preheat your oven to 300°</li>

            <li>Cook for exactly 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove the jambalaya, and set aside for 5 minutes. DO NOT UNCOVER UNTIL TIME IS UP!</li>
