        <h1>Etouffee</h1>

         <p>And last but not least, it's time to step away from the meats and grab some seafood.</p>

         <p>When people think of Louisiana, they think of two things: Swamps and Crawfish, and what better way to prove them right than serving up a plate of home-made crawfish etouffee. Perfect as a side or just a meal by itself, this dish will have you coming back for seconds and maybe even a midnight snack (just don't forget the tums).</p>
    
    
         <h3><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></h3>

         <ul>
             <li>2 Onions</li>
             <li>2 Sticks of Celery</li>
             <li>1 Green Bell Pepper</li>
             <li>1 Red Bell Pepper</li>
             <li>1 Bunch of Green Onions</li>
             <li>4 Cloves of Garlic</li>
             <li>2 Sticks of Butter</li>
             <li>1 Tablespoon Cajun or Creole Seasoning</li>
             <li>1/4 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper</li>
             <li>1/4 Teaspoon Salt</li>
             <li>1/3 Cup of Flour</li>
             <li>2 lbs Louisiana Crawfish</li>
             <li>2 Cups of Hot Water (Add more if desired)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong></h3>

         <ol>
             <li>Start out by heating a Pot or Large Pan to a Medium/Low heat.</li>
             <li>Chop the Onion, Celery, Red Bell Pepper, Green Bell Pepper, and Green Onions. </li>
             <li>Drop two Sticks of Butter into your hot pot and melt completely.</li>
             <li>Add the chopped vegetables to the pot and raise burner to a medium.</li>
             <li>Add the Cajun Seasoning, Cayenne Pepper, and Salt.</li>
             <li>Sauté for about 20 minutes. </li>
             <li>Meanwhile chop the four cloves of Garlic. </li>
             <li>After 20 minuets of sautéing, add the garlic and sauté for another 10 minutes. </li>
             <li>After 10 more minuets of sautéing, push the vegetables to one side of the pot, add the 1/3 cup of flour and blend into the butter. Once the flour is mixed in well, stir everything altogether. </li>
             <li>Sauté for another 30 minutes. Be very cautious during this time. If fire seems a little high, lower it. </li>
             <li>Around this time you want to begin cooking some rice. </li>
             <li>With about 3 minutes left of sautéing, begin heating 2 cups of water in the microwave. </li>
             <li>Add a little bit of the hot water to the pot, and stir until it’s a creamy mixture. </li>
             <li>Add the Crawfish and rest of the hot water to the pot. Blend evenly. </li>
             <li>Raise the heat to where you see a slight boil.</li>
             <li>Cover, and lower to a simmering heat. Cook for about 15-20 minutes. </li>
             <li><em>(f you feel as though you would like a thinner sauce, just add a little more water. However, taste to see if you need more seasoning.)</em></li>
         </ol>
